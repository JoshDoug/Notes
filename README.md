# Notes

A collection of notes, divided up into folders by topic.

Notes are inteneded to be a useful reference, easy to access all in one place, information should be convenient to find.
This is intended as a personal reference, most notes should be in my own words (as I find the processing of re-writing can help me better understand a topic), but in certain cases if I personally feel I wont benefit from a re-write and any attempt to do so will make it less concise with no forseeable benefit then I'll just copy it verbatim.
