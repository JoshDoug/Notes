# Gradle Introduction
so far, nicer than Maven's intro..
https://docs.gradle.org/3.4.1/userguide/userguide.html#gsc.tab=0
# Chapter 1. Introduction
## Brief Introduction
A very flexible general purpose built tool like Ant. - hmm need to look into Ant more, TKTK
Switchable, build-by-convention frameworks like Maven, but without the lock in. Nice, maven's 'everything should be maven approach is...great until you need something that isn't a maven project'

Powerful support for multi-project builds
Powerful dependency management based on Apache Ivy - based on the idea or forked from Ivy? Either way, I'm not familiar with Ivy.
Supports existing Maven or Ivy repo infrastructure, nice?

Support for transitive dependency management without the need for remote repositories or pom.xml and ivy.xml files.

Ant tasks and builds as first class citizens - irrelevant for me.

Groovy build scripts - more stuff to learn, yay?

A rich domain model for describing your build - what?

## 2.1 Features
A list of some of Gradle's features:

Declarative builds and build-by-convention
* At the heart of Gradle lies a rich DSL (Domain Specific Language) based on Groovy. Provides declarative Language elements that can be assembled as one likes. Those elements also provide build-by-convention support for Java, Groovy, OSGi, Web, and Scala projects.

Language for dependency based programming
* stuff
