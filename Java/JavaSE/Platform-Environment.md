## Configuration Utilities
Covers some of the config utils that help an application access its startup context.

### Properties
Properties are configuration values managed as key-value pairs, both the key and value are String values. The key is used to retrieve the value, like a variable. E.g. an application capable of downloading files might use a property named download.lastDirectory to keep track of the directory used for the last download.

To manage properties, create instances of java.util.Properties
