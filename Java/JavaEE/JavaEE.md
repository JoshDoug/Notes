## History, Present, Future (Present being Java EE7)

History:

* JPE Project - 1998
* J2EE 1.2 - 1999, Enterprise Java Platform with 10 specs such as Servlet, JSP, EJB, JMS, RMI/IOP
* J2EE 1.3 - 2001, 13 specs, Focus on Robustness, with CMP, Connector Architecture added
* J2EE 1.4 - 2003, 20 specs, Focus on Web Services, with Web Services, Managed, Deploymnet, Asynchronous Connector added
* Java EE 5 - 2006, 23 specs Focus on ease of development, Annotations, EJB 3.0, Persistence API, New and Updated Web Services (shift from XML & configuration to Annotations and convention)
* Java EE 6 - 2009, 28 specs, Focus on flexibility, extensibility, profiles, CDI, RESTful web services, EJB Lite, Managed Beans 1.0, and more.
* Java EE 7 - 2013, 28+ specs (33 APIs/Specs?), growth slows, fine tuning and improved programmer friendliness.
* Java EE 8 - focus on Cloud and Microservices, improvements to Servlets, CDI, JSON-P, JSF, JAX-RS, Bean Validation, and addition of JSON-B, Security, Configuration, and Health Check - 37 APIs?
* Java EE 9 or whatever comes next will continue this focus on cloud and microservices.

Java EE is:

* A set of APIs and runtime
* Consists of 28+ specifications
* All Java SE APIs can be used in combination with any Java EE component
* Annotation-based configuration, XML is (mostly?) optional, and convention over configuration
* Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI)

### Part 1: Introduction

### Chapter 1: Overview

Chapter introduces Java EE application development, covers development basics, Java EE architecture & APIs, important terms & concepts, and how to approach Java EE application programming, assembly, & depolyment.

#### Introduction to Java EE

The Java EE platform developed through the Java Community Process (JCP), expert groups create Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to define the various Java EE Technologies to help provide tools, software and APIs that can be used to build distributed, transactional, portable applications that are fast, secure, performant, and reliable.

The Java EE platform used a simplified programming model (compared to what?), XML descriptors are optional and instead a developer can use annotations directly in a Java source file. There's also dependency injection, helping to hide the creation and lookup of resources from application code, but I don't really understand that yet.

#### Java EE 8 Platform Highlights

* HTML5 and HTTP/2 Support
* [Java API for JSON Binding](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview008.html#java-api-for-json-binding)
* [Java EE Security API](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview008.html#java-ee-security-api)
* [Java API for JSON Processing](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview008.html#java-api-for-json-processing) improvements, such as JSON Pointer, Patch, and Merge Patch.
* New features for:
  * RESTful web services ([Java API for RESTful Web Services](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview008.html#java-api-for-restful-web-services))
  * Servlets ([Java Servlet Technology](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview008.html#java-servlet-technology))
  * JavaServer Faces ([JavaServer Faces Technology](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview008.html#javaserver-faces-technology))
  * Contexts and Dependency Injections features ([CDI for Java EE](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview008.html#contexts-and-dependency-injection-for-java-ee))
  * JavaBean validation ([Been Validation](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview008.html#bean-validation))

#### Java EE Application Model

Lots of corporate jargon and marketing speak, but basically Java EE provides a basis for creating complex enterprise level applications.

#### Distributed Multitiered Applications

The Java EE platform uses a distributed multitiered application model for enterprise applications, kinda like MVC on steroids. Application logic is divided into components according to function, and the applications components that make up a Java EE application are installed on various machines depending on the tier in the multitiered Java EE environment to which the application belongs (or it could all be on one machine, of course).

A typical multitiered application would have a client application/webpage, a Java EE Server, and a Database:

* Client-tier components run on the client machine (Application Client &/or Web Pages).
* Web-tier components run on the Java EE server (JavaServer Faces Pages).
* Business-tier components run on the Java EE server (Enterprise Beans).
* Enterprise information system (EIS)-tier software runs on the EIS server (Databases).

Security: it does some stuff for you? Unclear from the description.

Java EE Components: Java EE applications are made up of components which are a self-contained functional software unit that is assembled into a Java EE application with its related classes and files and that communicates with other components. The Java EE spec defines the following components:

* Application clients and applets are components that run on the client.
* Java Servlet, JavaServer Faces, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology components are web components that run on the server.
* EJB components (enterprise beans) are business components that run on the server.

> "Java EE components are written in the Java programming language and are compiled in the same way as any program in the language. The differences between Java EE components and "standard" Java classes are that Java EE components are assembled into a Java EE application, they are verified to be well formed and in compliance with the Java EE specification, and they are deployed to production, where they are run and managed by the Java EE server."

*So...they're normal Java but they run on a Java EE Server?*

#### [Java EE Containers](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview005.html)

_Write this section up at a later date once I can make sense of the marketing speel_.

#### [Web Services Support](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/overview006.html)

Java EE platform provides XML APIs and tools for designing, developing, testing, and deploying web services that use open XML-based standards and transport protocols.

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Transport Protocol - An XML-based protocol that is transmitted over HTTP. following the HTTP request-and-response model.

WSDL (Web Services Description Language) Standard Formt - A standardised XML format for describing network services, description includes the name, location and ways to communicate with the service. GlassFish Server provides a tool for generating the WSDL spec of a web service that uses remote procedure calls to communicate with clients.

#### Java EE Application Assembly and Deployment

A Java EE application is packaged into one or more standard units for deployment to any Java EE platform-compliant system. Each unit contains:

* A functional component or components, such as an enterprise bean, web page, servlet, or applet
* An optional deployment descriptor that describes its content

Once a Java EE unit has been produced, it is ready to be deployed. Deployment typically involves using a platformâ€™s deployment tool to specify location-specific information, such as a list of local users who can access it and the name of the local database. Once deployed on a local platform, the application is ready to run.

#### Java EE 8 APIs

Summaries of the technologies required by the Java EE platform and the APIs used in Java EE applications.

##### Enterprise JavaBeans Technology

An Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) component, or enterprise bean, is a body of code that has fields and methods to implement modules of business logic and is used as a building block, standalone or with other EJBs to execute business logic on the Java EE server.

Enterprise beans are either session beans or message-driven beans:

* A session bean
* A message-driven bean
