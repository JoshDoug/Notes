Spring is an opinionated and partially compatible and complementary alternative to Java EE. Spring requires certain Java EE API implementations, such as Servlet 3.1+, JPA 2.1+, and requires Java EE 7 level as a minimum while also providing integration with newer Java EE 8 APIs. This keeps Spring fully compatible with Tomcat 8 & 9, WebSphere 9, and JBoss EAP 7. Spring itself evolves with the addition of several projects since its inception, see [spring projects](https://spring.io/projects) for a full list.
