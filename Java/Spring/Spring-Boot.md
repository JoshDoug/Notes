# What is Spring Boot? I don't know this either tbh
Framework that does away with a lot of boiler plate code.
But what does this mean for me? Not much yet.

Interestingly, is Spring-Boot also a build tool as well as an application framework? It's touted as being able to create an executable jar that contains all the dependencies needed to run. Nice.
Or package as a WAR.

Has opinions, okay? If you have opinions, it will submit to them, cool?
Has an embedded Tomcat Server...nice? But if you want you can use Jetty instead by bringing those dependencies onto the classpath and Tomcat will step aside. Okay, hadn't heard of Jetty before - hosted on Eclipse.org, project page is not confidence inspiring (and last major update was in 2015..).

Auto-config and component scanning in an appropriate application context.

Automatic servlet mappings - nice

Dispatcher Servlet - handles all URL requests to root contexts
* hmm okay
