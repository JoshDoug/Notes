# POM Reference - Project Object Model
Notes from [Maven's POM Reference page](https://maven.apache.org).

The pom.xml project file is an XML representation of a Maven Project. It covers the who, what, where, as well as the when & how. It is declarative, unlike Ant which is procedural.

## Maven Coordinates - groupId:artifactId:version
e.g. 'org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-deploy-plugin:2.7'
