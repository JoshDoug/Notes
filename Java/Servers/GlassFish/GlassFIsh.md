## GlassFish Commands

Prefix a command with the absolute or relative path to asadmin and then the option/command to run, e.g. `/Applications/Servers/glassfish5/glassfish/bin/asadmin list-domains`, `glassfish/bin/asadmin list-domains`, or `./asadmin list-domains` to list the current domains and whether or not they're running.
