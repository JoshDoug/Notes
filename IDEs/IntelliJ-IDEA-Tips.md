# IntelliJ IDEA Tips

Focus on neat little features, whereas the main IntelliJ IDEA notes section focuses on notes from their longform documentation.

## Debugging

Add watches for a variable or even expression (like an array: `chars[i]`) using the watches tab in Debug mode or by right clicking a variable and choosing 'Add to Watches'.

Set a conditional breakpoint: right click a breakpoint and a popup appears, then a condition can be set, e.g. `i==5` and the breakpoint will only suspend the program when this condition is true.
