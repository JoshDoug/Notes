Octave is an Open Source Matlab replacement, that provides a source compatible language compiler and an equivalent - although not identical - IDE/GUI environment.

The prompt can be changed in a way similar to bash, e.g. `PS1 >>` would change the prompt to `>>`, `PS1 '>> '` to add a space after the prompt. This change only lasts for the duration of the session.

## Help System

To get help on help: `help help`

* Help on pi: `help pi`

The full documentation can be displayed using `doc`, but this is more easily navigated online. The default macOS installation is incomplete and doesn't include doc.
