# Python

Python 3 is the current major version of Python, specifically 3.6.2 at the time of writing this.

There are several implementations of Python:

* CPython - the original and de-factor reference Python implementation
* IronPython - runs on .NET using the CLR - still on 2.7, 3.x is in development
* Jython - runs on the JVM, still on 2.7, 3.x is in development
* Pyston - Dropbox's open source Python implementation which focuses on speed - not being actively developed now

Python is stuck in an ugly transition, with Python 3 having broken backwards compatibility in signifcant ways with its release in 2008. Page that covers which version to choose: [Python2orPython3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3), spoiler - choose 3 unless you absolutely have to use 2 because of dependencies or environment.
