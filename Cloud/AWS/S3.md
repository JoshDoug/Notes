# Amazon S3: Simple Storage Service

* [Amazon S3 Website](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

S3 has no defined limit, it can scale and grow with the storage needs of an organisation, but each object is limited to 5TB.

Object storage. Objects are stored in a flat organisation, referred to as buckets in S3 and retrieved by a unique ID (key). The flat hierarchy allows for greater scalability and faster retrieval than a normal file hierachy.

RRS - Reduced Redundancy Storage, this comes at a reduced cost and can be used for easily reproduced data.

S3 works on an eventual consistency model, so the objects are highly available and highly durable, but the data consistency is only achieved eventually. It takes time to propagate the changes to all the replicas.
