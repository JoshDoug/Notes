## [What is Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)

Docker is a software container platform. According to Docker's marketing speel it helps do the following:

* Provides a consistent environment for collaboration and helps avoid "Works on my machine"
* Run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density
* Build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely, and with confidence for both Linux, Windows Server, and Linux-on-mainframe apps.

What is a container?

Containers are a way to isolate, package, and run software on a shared operating system. Unlike VMs, containers don't bundle a full OS and virtualise it, this makes them more lightweight and efficient but with many of the advantages of VMs. The most important aspect is that the software always runs the same, regardless of where it's deployed.
