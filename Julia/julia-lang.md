# Julia Language

## Juno

Juno is the defacto IDE for Julia, and is a plugin for Atom. Julia can also be used via the REPL on the command line or with a text editor.

## Julia and Jupyter with IJulia

IJulia can be used by installing the `IJulia` package with `Pkg.add("IJulia")`, then simply run `notebook()` from the REPL.

## Language Basics

* `;` use a semicolon to suppress output for a statement, postfixed, much likes MatLab does.
* `?` prefix a question mark to get docs for a function
* `;` to use a shell command, *prefix* it with a semicolon
