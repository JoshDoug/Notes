# Julia Language

## Juno

Juno is the defacto IDE for Julia, and is a plugin for Atom. Julia can also be used via the REPL on the command line or with a text editor.

## Julia and Jupyter with IJulia

IJulia can be used by installing the `IJulia` package with `Pkg.add("IJulia")`, then simply run `notebook()` from the REPL.
