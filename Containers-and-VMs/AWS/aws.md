## Data

EBS (Elastic Block Storage) is long term storage, whereas local storage lasts the length of a running instance.

## Networking

* Elastic IPs - static but not instance specific, instead they are created at the account level and easily mapped and remapped to instances. This allows for simple failovers between servers to easily reroute traffic, this also works great for rolling out  application update.

## Regions

AWS has locations in several geographic regions, and each region has availability zones. Multiple availability zones and even regions can be utilised incase of disasters.
