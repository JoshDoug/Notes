# GHCi

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler interpreter is an interactive Haskell REPL that comes with GHC. At the GHCi prompt, you can evaluate expressions, load Haskell files with :load (:l) (and reload them with :reload (:r)), ask for the type of an expression with :type (:t), and many other things (try :? for a list of commands).
