# MatLab - Matrix Labratory

Everything is a matrix, when `a = 1`, a is a 1x1 matrix.

## Variables

* Assignment: `a = pi` creates variable `a` and sets it to `pi`.
* Assignment with suppressed output: `b = pi;` assigns `pi` to `b` but doesn't display the result.
* String assignment: `c = 'Hello World'`, single or double quotes work.
