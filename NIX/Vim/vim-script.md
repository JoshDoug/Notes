## Chapter 1

Vimscript and Vim commands overlap heavily, so typical commands such as `:w` or `:write` can be used within scripts.

## Echoing Messages

Looking at the `echo` and `echom` commands, from within vim run the command: `:echo "Hello, world!"` and will be output at the bottom of the page. Checkout the documentation for each command with `:help echo` and `:help echom`, it's worth making a habit of checking out the inbuilt documentation regularly.
