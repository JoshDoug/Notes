# DevOps

* [The Agile Admin](https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops)

The practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support.

DevOps involves the collaboration of everyone on the Devlopment side (programmers, QA, front-end designers) and the Operations side (Linux admins, network admins, DBAs)

A (very American) breakdown of 'The Five Levels of Devops':

* Values
* Principles
* Methods
* Practices
* Tools

Why DevOps? - According to Puppet Labs

* High-performing IT organisations deploy more frequently, fail less, and recover faster.
* Lean management and continuous delivery practices help deliver value faster.
* High performance is achievable whether your apps are greenfield, brownfield, or legacy. What?
