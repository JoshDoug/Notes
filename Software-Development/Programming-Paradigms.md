# Programming Paradigms, Models, and Styles

Programming languages can be classified into paradigms based on their featues, languages can support multiple paradigms.

* [Side Effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science))
* [Programming Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_model)
* [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce)
* [Comparison of Multi-Paradigm languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_multi-paradigm_programming_languages)

Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar.

Common programming paradigms include:

* imperative which allows side effects,
* functional which disallows side effects,
* declarative which does not state the order in which operations execute,
* object-oriented which groups code together with the state the code modifies,
* procedural which groups code into functions,
* logic which has a particular style of execution model coupled to a particular style of syntax and grammar, and
* symbolic programming which has a particular style of syntax and grammar.

### Java

Java's newer functional features:

* [Higher Order Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function)
* [Lazy Evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation)
