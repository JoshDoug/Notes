# General Notes about R

R is a statistical programming language. It is, popular, open source, and gaining traction in a space
typically dominated by SAS, SPSS, Stata, and MATLAB.

R is useful for vector based mathematics, which is a more mathematical way to say working with data in arrays.
It can be easier to work with arrays of numbers without for loops.

## R Environment

Comments in R: `#`.

`1:100` prints out 1 to 100.

R print statement: `print("Hello World)` # No semicolons necessary in R.

### Variables

`x <- 1:5` # Assigning the values 1 to 5 to variable x, sometimes described as 'x *gets* values 1 to 5'

`y <- c(6,7,8,9,10)` # The concatenate function, useful for specifying data to put in the variable

`x + y` # Add the contents of each vector/array, such that the output would be: 7,9,11,13,15

`x * 2` # Multiplies each element in the vector, such that the output would be: 2,4,6,8,10

## RStudio

To run a line: `cmd-enter`.
