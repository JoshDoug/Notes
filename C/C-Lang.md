## Preprocssor Commands

Directives:

* `#include <file>` - used for system header files located in the standard list of system directories
* `#include file` - user for header files in your own programs (or just any non-standard header file?)
* `#define name` - used to define a macro, e.g. `#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024`, then just refer to `BUFFER_SIZE` in the code, is this a constant then?

## Types

* float - floating point number
* double - like float, but with twice the memory for larger floating point numbers
