## Create React App

To create a project use the command: `npm init create-react-app my-project` or alternatively `npx create-react-app my-project`, these both do the same thing. There's no need to insteall anything from npm for this step like with similar tools such as `angular-cli` or `vue-cli`. The project is intialised with a git repo and offers some useful commands:

* `npm start` - starts the development server.
* `npm run build` - bundles the app into static files for production.
* `npm test` - starts the test runner.
* `npm run eject` - removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

Alternatively `create react app` can be installed globally like other tools: `npm install -g create-react-app` and then just `create-react-app my-project` to create a new project.
