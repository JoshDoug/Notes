# Using XDebug

Not sure if there's any other decent PHP debuggers, but notes on XDebug here.

Setup is mostly covered with PHPStorm.md notes.

Install with brew: `brew install php71-xdebug` or whatever relevant version.

## [Remote Starting](https://xdebug.org/docs/remote#starting)

Just set the IDE Key in the extension, or maybe in PHPSTORM (might be unneccessary).

## Create Bookmarklets with the Jetbrains [PhpStorm Bookmarklet Page](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/marklets/)

Handy way of creating bookmarks to use to start and stop the debugger, alternatively use the xdebugger chrome extension. Also works for the zend debugger.
